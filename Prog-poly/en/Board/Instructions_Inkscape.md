# Instructions for Using the Original File in Inkscape

This document provides basic instructions to open, edit, and export the original board file using Inkscape, an open-source vector editor.

## About Inkscape

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is an open-source vector editor that uses SVG as its native format. The program can accurately read and write SVG files and also allows exporting to other formats such as EPS. Although its user interface may not be as elegant as other solutions, Inkscape is a powerful tool once you become familiar with it.

## Installation

1. **Download:** Visit the official Inkscape website ([inkscape.org](https://inkscape.org/)) and download the version compatible with your operating system.
2. **Installation:** Follow the installation instructions provided on the website. On Windows, the installer is usually straightforward, while on Linux and macOS you might need to follow specific guidelines found in the official documentation.

## Opening the File

1. Open Inkscape.
2. In the top menu, click **File** > **Open...**.
3. Select the SVG file of the board available in the repository.
4. Wait until the file is fully loaded to ensure all elements are correctly displayed.

## Editing the File

- **Selection Tool:** Use the selection tool (shortcut `S`) to select and move board elements.
- **Layers:** Check if the file is organized into layers. If not, you can create new layers to better organize editable elements.
- **Vector Editing:** To modify shapes, use the node editing tool (shortcut `N`). This tool allows you to adjust anchor points and curves of the vectors.
- **Text and Colors:** Double-click on texts to edit them or use the toolbar to change colors, sizes, and styles.

## Exporting

Once you finish your edits, you can export the file in different formats:

- **Save as SVG:** To maintain editability, save your work in the SVG format. In the menu, select **File** > **Save As...** and choose SVG.
- **Export to EPS:** If you need a format compatible with other editing software, choose **File** > **Save As...** and select EPS.
- **Image Export:** If you require a rasterized image (e.g., PNG), go to **File** > **Export PNG...** and configure the resolution and export area options.

## Additional Tips

- **Tutorials:** If you're new to Inkscape, it's recommended to explore tutorials and the official documentation available on the [Inkscape Learn](https://inkscape.org/learn/) page.
- **Shortcuts:** Get familiar with keyboard shortcuts to speed up your editing process. A complete list can be found in the Inkscape documentation.
- **Backup:** Always make a copy of the original file before making significant changes, ensuring you can revert to the initial version if necessary.
